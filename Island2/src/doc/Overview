Planen:
Du har fått en liten plätt mark på 1200 - talet av din snälla kusin Dragan.
Livet är svårt på den här tiden och du måste leva marken, och skaffa dig ett emperium.
Bäst gör du detta genom att börja hugga ved, bygga nya byggnader med detta och expandera!
May I wish you the best luck.

TASKS:
1. Make a system that is capable of storing different values of different materials. OK 
2. A system that handels what kind of building are built                             OK
